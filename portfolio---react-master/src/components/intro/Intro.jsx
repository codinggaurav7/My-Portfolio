          <p>Iâ€™ve spent the last several months in a remote environment, working with  Front end and backend technologies with solving doubts of more than 500 developers in India as a TA at Coding Ninja , also building everything from landing pages to deployed websites. I have expertise in Data Structures And Algorithm along with OOPs concept. Additionally, it was not easy for me but, it has helped me become efficient, productive, and fast even in a very stressful environment, which is an important skill in the tech industry.</p>
